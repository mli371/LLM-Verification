Her savings, tucked safely in a local bank, amounted to $32,560, a fund she intended to use for her twin sons' college education in 5 years. The twins, Alex and Max, were turning 12 this November and were eagerly planning their first camping trip to Lake Silver, roughly 18 miles away. At the local bookstore, Sara recently splashed $124 on 6 bestselling novels, delighting her book club, which meets every Thursday. Last month, the community library logged a record 320 new book enrollments and extended their hours by 2 days a week. Meanwhile, the town's annual marathon drew 1,500 participants, 400 more than the previous year, raising over $30,000 for local charities.
